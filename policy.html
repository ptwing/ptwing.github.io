    <p>You recognize and agree that the analytics companies utilized by Ptwing may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products relating to your activities. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.<br />
    </p>
    <p>Personal Data</p>
    <p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personal data” means personally identifiable information that specifically identifies you as an individual.<br />

Ptwing may combine non-personal data with personal data.</p>
    <p>Please note that certain features of the Services may be able to connect to your social networking sites to obtain additional information about you.  In such cases, Ptwing may be able to collect certain information from your social networking profile when your social networking site permits it, and when you consent to allow your social networking site to make that information available to Ptwing.

    <p>Disclosure and Transfer of Personal Data</p>
    <p>Ptwing collects and processes personal data on a voluntary basis and it is not in the business of selling your personal data to third parties. Personal data may, however, occasionally be disclosed in accordance with applicable legislation and this Privacy Policy. Additionally, Ptwing may disclose personal data to its parent companies and its subsidiaries in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Ptwing may hire agents and contractors to collect and process personal data on Ptwing’s behalf and in such cases such agents and contractors will be instructed to comply with our Privacy Policy and to use personal data only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by Ptwing. These agents and contractors may not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes. Ptwing may use third party service providers such as credit card processors, e-mail service providers, shipping agents, data analyzers and business intelligence providers. Ptwing has the right to share your personal data as necessary for the aforementioned third parties to provide their services for Ptwing. Ptwing is not liable for the acts and omissions of these third parties, except as provided by mandatory law.</p>
    <p>Ptwing may disclose your personal data to third parties as required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or Ptwing to legal liability. Ptwing may also disclose your personal data to third parties when Ptwing has a reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with Ptwing’s rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or Ptwing believes that such disclosure is necessary to protect Ptwing’s rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Ptwing. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Ptwing will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such disclosure through Ptwing’s website or in another reasonable manner.</p>
    <p>Safeguards</p>
    <p>Ptwing follows generally accepted industry standards and maintains reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information in Ptwing’s possession. Only those persons with a need to process your personal data in connection with the fulfillment of their tasks in accordance with the purposes of this Privacy Policy and for the purposes of performing technical maintenance, have access to your personal data in Ptwing’s possession. Personal data collected by Ptwing is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. To prevent unauthorized on-line access to personal data, Ptwing maintains personal data behind a firewall-protected server. However, no system can be 100% secure and there is the possibility that despite Ptwing’s reasonable efforts, there could be unauthorized access to your personal data. By using the Services, you assume this risk.</p>
    <p>Other</p>
    <p>Please be aware of the open nature of certain social networking and other open features of the Services Ptwing may make available to you. You may choose to disclose data about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to the Services. Any data that you disclose in any of these forums, blogs, chats or the like is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality. Ptwing is not responsible for any personal data you choose to make public in any of these forums.</p>
    <p>If you are under 15 years of age or a minor in your country of residence, please ask your legal guardian’s permission to use or access the Services. Ptwing takes children’s privacy seriously, and encourages parents and/or guardians to play an active role in their children's online experience at all times. Ptwing does not knowingly collect any personal information from children below the aforementioned age and if Ptwing learns that Ptwing has inadvertently gathered personal data from children under the aforementioned age, Ptwing will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such personal data from Ptwing’s records.</p>
    <p>Ptwing may store and/or transfer your personal data to its affiliates and partners in and outside of EU/EEA member states and the United States in accordance with mandatory legislation and this Privacy Policy. Ptwing may disclose your personal data to third parties in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of Ptwing’s stock and/or assets or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process provided, however, that this Privacy Policy shall continue to govern such personal data.<br />
    </p>
    <p>Ptwing regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. If Ptwing receives a formal written complaint from you, it is Ptwing’s policy to attempt to contact you directly to address any of your concerns. Ptwing will cooperate with the appropriate governmental authorities, including data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the collection, use, transfer or disclosure of personal data that cannot be amicably resolved between you and Ptwing.</p>
