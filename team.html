Ptwing reserves the right to change the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time and such changes will be effective upon notice to you.

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Ptwing grants to you (i) a nontransferable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide license to permit those individuals authorized by you (“Users”) to use, execute and display the Application, in executable object code format only, solely for your own internal business operations.  You agree to use the Application only for lawful purposes, and in a way that does not infringe the rights of, restrict or inhibit anyone else’s use of the Application.</p>
    <p>2.    Restrictions.  The rights granted to you in this Agreement are subject to the following restrictions: (a) you shall not license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, display, host, outsource, disclose or otherwise commercially exploit or make the Application available to any third party other than an authorized User; (b) you shall not modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, reverse compile or reverse engineer any part of the Application; (c) you shall not access the Application to build a similar or competitive product or service; (d) except as expressly stated herein, no part of the Application may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any means, including but not limited to electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording or other means; and (e) any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Application shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>3.    Collection of Data.  By participating user experience analytics, you allow an agent running in the background. It will collect the user experience data to help Ptwing’s future improvements, as further described in our privacy policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
    <p>4.    Disclaimer of Warranties.  The Application is provided to you free of charge, and on an “AS-IS” basis.  Ptwing provides no technical support, warranties or remedies for the Application.  You acknowledge that Ptwing is not responsible for any damage, loss, liability or result caused by widgets from other developers. Ptwing and its suppliers disclaim all express, implied or statutory warranties relating to the Application, including but not limited to, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.
